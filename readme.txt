Hello! Wellcome to Zenbot trading bot addon.

 With this addon you will get data about 40 different strategies profits or losses of cryptocurrencies of your choice. 
 Based on this data you will be able to decide which strategy to choose for trading.
 All you need is to provide cryptocurrency pair and period you are
 interested in.

 Steps which are performed by addon are:
 1) Generate backfilling commands for Zenbot and run them as a subprocess for downloading real historical
 data from Binance.eu exchange for provided period, and cryptocurrency-pair.
 2) Generate and run Zenbot simulation commands on provided period and cryptocurrency pair which generates HTML file for each strategy.
 3) Scrape all HTML files of simulations into .txt file.
 4) Show all data in a html page.

 Be patient. Steps 1 and 2 takes some time. But don't worry all process
